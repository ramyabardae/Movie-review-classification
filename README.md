# Movie-review-classification
Binary classification of IMDB movie reviews using Tensor flow &amp; NLTK


The data set is taken from Kaggle.com. It basically has 50 thousand IMDB reviews. This data
set has to be spilt in such a way that it should have 25 thousand reviews for training and 25 
thousand reviews for testing. In this project I am going to predict if the review is a positive or 
negative review by binary classifications of these movie reviews using TensorFlow and 
NTKL (natural language tool kit). This project is a sentiment analysis classifier problem.
